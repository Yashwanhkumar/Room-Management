Description
This application provides a centralized platform for bachelors or roommates living together to manage common tasks and costs. A user can create a "Room," which generates a unique invite code to share with their roommates. Once members join a room, they share a common dashboard where they can add services (like "Buy Groceries" or "Pay Wi-Fi Bill"), log the costs associated with those services, and view a collective list of tasks.

The application also features a special dashboard for the room's creator (the "Owner") to view monthly expense summaries and an admin panel for site administrators to oversee all activity.

Key Features
#UserAuthentication: Secure user registration with email verification, login, and logout.

#RoomManagement:

Users can create a "Room" for their living space.

Each room has a unique, automatically generated invite code.

Roommates can join a room easily using the invite code.

#SharedDashboard:

A collaborative dashboard for each room, visible to all its members.

Members can add new services and view all services added to the room.

#ExpenseTracking:

For each service, members can add detailed records, including a description and cost.

Costs are tracked in Indian Rupees (â‚¹).

#RoleBasedAccess:

The creator of a room has access to an exclusive "Owner Dashboard."

This dashboard displays key statistics like total members, total services logged, and a summary of the current month's total expenses.

#AdminPanel:

A comprehensive admin dashboard for site administrators (staff users).

View summary statistics for the entire application.

Search, filter, edit, and delete any service record across all rooms.
