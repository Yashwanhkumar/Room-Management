Bachelor Room Management App
A collaborative web application built with Django to help roommates manage shared services and track expenses within their living space.

Description
This application provides a centralized platform for bachelors or roommates living together to manage common tasks and costs. A user can create a "Room," which generates a unique invite code to share with their roommates. Once members join a room, they share a common dashboard where they can add services (like "Buy Groceries" or "Pay Wi-Fi Bill"), log the costs associated with those services, and view a collective list of tasks.

The application also features a special dashboard for the room's creator (the "Owner") to view monthly expense summaries and an admin panel for site administrators to oversee all activity.

Key Features
User Authentication System: Secure user registration with email verification, login, and logout.

Users can create a "Room" for their living space.

Each room has a unique, automatically generated invite code.

Costs are tracked in Indian Rupees (â‚¹).
